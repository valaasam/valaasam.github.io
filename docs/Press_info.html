<p>I was recently invited to present for the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, as part of their “Shared Planet Shared Health” webinar series. The recording is archived here!</p>
<p>This is the first time I have gotten written feedback on an outreach talk and it was amazing!</p>
<p>“Dr.&nbsp;Alaasam shared some great information and lots of easy takeaways!”</p>
<p>“Excellent presenter”.</p>
<p>“Love seeing presentations like this with actionable messages, like here’s a problem but you can actually help solve it.”</p>
<p>There was a complete mix of appreciation for scientific research facts/findings, actionable steps, and basic presentation quality. Just goes to show that presentations with a little bit of everything go a long way. Learning styles are diverse. There are always people in the audience to will remember the data and follow the technical science, those who need the information to be relevant to their own behaviors and habits, and those who will only stay engaged with nice pictures and stupid jokes (I can relate to that last one). Giving talks like this is for sure top 5 favorite parts of my job.</p>

<p>Though my dissertation research focused on the effects of light pollution on birds, I always jump at any opportunity to talk about how light at night impacts other organisms. Everything is connected, and conservation requires this kind of multi-level thinking. As I put it in this BBC article, when different species have various kinds of responses to light pollution (like birds, insects and plants, which all interact), we get some ecological chaos!</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="science-in-the-wild-patagonia">Science in the Wild <span class="citation" data-cites="Patagonia">@Patagonia</span></h2>
<p>Last week I was invited to participate in an event called “Science in the Wild”, hosted by our local Patagonia branch and organized by graduate students in the Department of Natural Resources from the University of Nevada. We each gave a 10-minute popular science talk about our research, emphasizing a “call to action” or specific actions the public can do to be a positive influence for local conservation. I was able to share my work about the effects of light pollution on birds, and some easy steps people can take to minimize impacts! Light pollution is an ecological concern that literally exists our backyards - it doesn’t get more local than that!</p>
<p>Here is my call to action:</p>
<p>Replace: Change any bright white light bulbs that are used outdoors to softer, more yellow hues. My research has shown that warmer colored lights are less disruptive for birds. Avoiding the short (blue) wavelengths that are present in whiter light is better for us humans trying to sleep too!</p>
<p>Redirect: Make sure the light we are using outdoors is going where it’s intended! That means getting covers for street or porch lamps so that they point downward at the street or sidewalk, and not out into the air or surrounding natural habitats. Additionally, use curtains to prevent the light use indoors from spilling out into the environment.</p>
<p>Reduce: On a broad scale, many cities have adopted “lights out” policies to reduce the amount of night light during critical life history events, such as migration or breeding. As individuals, we can reduce night light by investing in motion-sensors (so that lights only turn on when we need them!), or dimmers so that we can reduce the intensity of light when there is extra reflectance (like when there is snow cover).</p>
<p>Remove: Talk to your local policy makers or employers about removing lights that are redundant or unnecessary. It’s a win-win, reducing impacts on wildlife and saving everyone energy and money!</p>

<p>At the 2019 American Ornithological Society Conference I was invited to be a part of a video series organized by the Conservation Media Program at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, where we told stories about our scientific journey with the intention of showcasing diversity in science! Here is one where we talked about the most useful piece of advice we received, and another answering why we do science!</p>
<p>For many women and trans and non-binary people, gender has historically been a barrier to full participation in ornithology. For our 2019 meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, the American Ornithological Society worked with the Conservation Media Program at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to produce three short videos of contemporary ornithologists telling the stories of themselves as scientists. Our objectives were to highlight diverse profiles of scientists, to show viewers that diversity is a welcome and indispensable part of a strong science community, and to contribute to the Diversity and Inclusion Committee’s work to reduce barriers to conference attendance.</p>

Thankful for the amazing group of colleagues and mentors at the University of Nevada, and can’t stress enough how important these programs are for opening closed doors and facilitating quality research.

<p>Sometimes science-ing is hard. My students and I occasionally have to stay awake for 24 hours taking blood samples from our birds, in order to study how light pollution disrupts nocturnal rest and circadian rhythms. Spoiler alert - not getting enough sleep stresses birds out, and staying up all night to document it stresses me out too! Thankfully I have some amazing students and we get creative, finding ways to keep ourselves awake and in a good mood.</p>

<p>Not all lighting technologies are the same. Since the invention of the first electric light, the development of new technologies continually alters the spectral composition of ALAN emitted into the environment.</p>
<p>In just the past decade light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have replaced older lighting technologies as a cheaper and more energy efficient alternative and are commercially available in a variety of spectra. Variation in spectral composition affects how organisms perceive night-light, and determines biological responses - for example, many organisms are particularly sensitive to the short-wavelength light produced by the most common “white” LEDs (e.g.&nbsp;5000K). However, few studies have compared broad spectrum LED lights that are commercially available and widely used.</p>

<p>A cool video about my undergraduate research working with Dr.&nbsp;Cathy Bodinof Jachowski on the eastern hellbender! There is so much to learn from these freshwater salamanders. Perhaps the most amazing species I will ever work with.</p>
