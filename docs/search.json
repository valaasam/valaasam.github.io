    "text": "Valentina J. Alaasam, Ph.D.\n\n\nBehavior * Physiology * Urbanization * Evolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am an integrative biologist interested in the behavioral, physiological, and eco-evolutionary mechanisms by which animals respond to anthropogenic change. I study this in cities - a ‘natural experiment’ where the speed and magnitude of change is unprecedented and the intersection of multiple stressors (e.g. light, noise and air pollution, heat, habitat loss/fragmentation, invasive species, etc.) is especially potent. I also use cities as a bridge to engage with local communities and leverage what we learn to promote urban designs that nurture both human diversity and biodiversity.\n\n\nI am currently an NSF postdoctoral fellow studying how hummingbirds are adapting to urbanization. I received my Ph.D. in Ecology, Evolution and Conservation Biology from the University of Nevada, Reno, where my dissertation focused on the effects of light pollution on sleep, circadian rhythms, and stress physiology in zebra finches. Check out my research page for more information.\n\n\nWhen I’m not doing science, I rock climb, backpack, run, ski uphill, cook, craft, and fight for social justice in both science and outdoor spaces.

    "text": "About me\n\n\n\n\n\nThe action of doing science - asking questions, taking measurements, testing hypotheses - is only one component of being a scientist. There are many other roles I play, and motivations behind the work that I do.\n\nHere are some of the things I am especially passionate about:\n\nConservation · Education · DEI\n\n\n\n\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\n\n\n\n\nThere is a table where scientists gather after a day in the field, lab or classroom - swapping stories over beers, or filling up on coffee before an evening lecture. At the table is the luxury of being curious and creative. At the table is education, mentorship, confidence, and growth.\nHistorically, this table was mostly male.\nStill today, this table is mostly White. \nSystemic exclusion is when the faces and voices at a table fail to represent the groups of people desiring a seat. When the projected image of a scientist is singular, it sends a message of who is allowed to be there, and underrepresented groups place ourselves in the stands instead of at the starting line. Moreover, exclusive environments redefine what it means to fail; instead of an invitation to solve problems, failure becomes a voice of self-doubt that says, why am I even trying?\nThe voice that says I don’t belong at the table.\nDiversifying the faces and voices at the table of STEM and academia is thus a critical step towards dismantling the glass ceiling that limits who has access. I am committed to supporting women, BIPOC and LGBTQIA+ communities, celebrating multiculturalism & neurodiversity, respecting the complexity of diverse lived experiences, and resisting divisive forces that perpetuate social injustice in the scientific and academic communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConservation\nNature isn’t always cute. Sometimes it’s slimy, poop-colored and has a large set of teeth, grinning at you from dark crevices in the bottom of the river.\nI originally pursued biology to “save all the animals” from things like pollution and deforestation, but as a teenager I was mainly concerned with what I thought were “cute” animals - polar bears, sea turtles, maybe dolphins. I saw that conservation was important, but had grown up uncomfortable in the outdoors and actually afraid of most wildlife. Instead, my first field experience ended up being with the eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis), or ‘snot-otters’ as they are known colloquially across their range in rural Appalachia. Of course, as I got to know these creatures I quickly recognized them as the most beautiful, interesting, and unique herps in North America (shameless bias here), sadly also in decline. I also came to realize that I was not alone in my original discomfort with them. Much of the local community, fortunate enough to grow up with this amazing species in their backyards, were afraid of them too. Hellbenders were my introduction to the real challenge of conservation: motivating people to connect with, and care about, topics that are unfamiliar or uncomfortable.\nI believe that with some effort it is always possible to find a connection that is meaningful to someone, to help bridge the gap between humans and their environment. In my work, it is often achieved by simply introducing someone to the species in their backyard. A single interaction can spark the realization that everything is connected - air, water, soil, microbes, the cells in our bodies, and all life on earth. As a scientist, discovering and describing those connections means little without the support of our communities helping to conserve them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEducation\nTo study ecology or biology involves immersing ourselves in a foreign experience - the experience of an organism or system in nature. We practice understanding how it operates within the context of, for example, its motivations, evolutionary constraints or stochasticity.\nIt is no suprise, then, that learning requires empathy. How well students know and understand something is a direct consequence of previous experiences (or lack thereof) and reflects the lens they are looking through.\nI believe the role of an educator is to provide students with new experiences and lenses that will expand their fields of view. When we ask students to just memorize information, it gets filed into whatever existing folders they already have and no growth is made. To expand fields of view, my goal is to teach students how to consistently reorganize knowledge and make space for new folders. In other words, to probe at habitual trains of thought & encourage disembarkment without forceful derailment.\nMy priorities as an educator are to 1) help students become empathetic learners and comfortable asking questions in unfamiliar spaces; 2) be inclusive of diverse learning styles, starting lines, and limitations, and allow students to direct their own learning process when possible; 3) be transparent about how my own experience influences my perspective and be open to amendments in how/what I teach; 4) encourage colleagues to actively improve the education system, challenge practices that perpetuate inequity, and work together to change them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWork-life balance\nEveryone deserves to have work-life balance, but there is not a one-size-fits-all model for achieving it. As academics, our daily, monthly, and annual workloads can be extremely individualized; even colleagues at the same institution or studying similar systems can have vastly different schedules and mosaics of responsibility.\n\n\nTo encourage more transparency in the diversity of work and life experiences, colleagues and I have developed this shiny app tool, where you can turn your life into an abstract blob of color - for fun and reflection.\n\nHere is me in 2023 - A beautiful mess, that somehow works for me :) Read more about re-conceptualizing work and life as a dynamic equilibrium in our recent article in Trends in Ecology & Evolution"

    "text": "Urbanization, Ecology & Evolution\nGlobal urbanization is expanding and intensifying - there has been a tripling of urban land cover since 2000 and 68% of people are projected to inhabit cities by 2050. With urbanization comes unprecedented biotic and abiotic changes such as air, noise and light pollution, impervious surfaces, habitat fragmentation, novel inter- and intra-species interactions and an overall reduction in biodiversity. As consequence, many species avoid and/or decline in cities, but others persist and even thrive. For city dwellers, these environmental changes impose selection pressure that may be driving evolution and population divergence. Furthermore, urbanization affects neutral evolutionary processes that impact the distribution of genetic variation, which can in turn affect the adaptive potential and persistence of species. Understanding the variation in traits within and across species along an urban gradient can help us predict how species will adapt in the future to an increasingly warm and urbanized landscape."

As consequence, mechanisms for detecting and responding to patterns of light and dark exist in all organisms and play a key role in the timing of cyclic behavioral and physiological processes. Artificial light at night (ALAN) disrupts these natural photoperiodic cues, and has severe effects on behavior, physiology, health, and ecosystem function. Furthermore, ALAN may be one of the most universally threatening pollutants on earth - reaching beyond city limits into national parks and conservation reserves, and affecting nearly all ecosystems from dense forests to coastlines and oceans. Understanding how to mitigate the effects of ALAN on organisms is a prominent conservation priority. In the lab, my research aims to understand the effects of light pollution in isolation from other urban stressors, and describing the mechanisms by which night light affects behavior, physiology and health in vertebrates."

However, within urban landscapes there is also substantial heterogeneity, as greenness often covaries with socioeconomic variables such as household income and historical redlining. This can lead to the “Luxury Effect” where biodiversity is positively correlated with surrounding affluence. I am interested in understanding how the socioeconomic landscape effects urban wildlife, & and understanding how public repositories such as iNaturalist and eBird may contribute to potential biases based on user demographics. My current project examining luxury effects on biodiversity in New York City parks has received some amazing support from the broader NYC community!

    "text": "Isolating pollutants in the lab\nCities are full of environmental changes that can have energetic consequences for individuals, effecting survival and reproduction. This poses a problem for conservation - but how can we design better cities if we don’t know which change is causing the problem? In the lab, we can isolate components of urbanization to detangle their respective effects. For example, I used zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to study how artificial light at night affects behavior and physiology. In this controlled environment I can measure activity, sleep and circadian rhythms using an automated perch that records movement every second 24/7. I use bioassays to measure physiological correlates of behavior such as hormonal rhythms (melatonin, glucocorticoids), and physiological stress (e.g. glucocorticoids, oxidative stress, biomarkers of cardiovascular dysfunction).\n\n \n\n\nAlaasam et al., 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMolecular Mechanisms\nWhat are the molecular mechanisms underlying behavioral and physiological responses? To understand this, my research involves using next-generation sequencing techniques to measure differences in gene expression resulting from exposure to various environmental conditions. For example, I have shown that behavioral and endocrine disruption resulting from light pollution exposure occurs independently from the central circadian clock. RNA sequencing of red blood cells, which is minimally invasive and allows for repeated measures of gene expression within-individuals, revealed processes underlying habituation to light pollution over time. I have also developed methods in immunocytochemistry enabling us to to map neuron activity in the brain during exposure to night-light.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Hui et al., 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal biases in urban ecology\nCurrent understanding of urban ecology and evolution is alarmingly biased, stemming disproportionally from the wealthiest nations. This is a problem because the evolutionary outcomes of urbanization likely depend on geographic and ecological context and can vary substantially across latitude. Latin America represents the second most urbanized global region, with 81% of habitants living in urban areas, and contains over 40% of the world’s avian biodiversity, yet current knowledge about the effect of urbanization on organisms is biased toward temperate regions (e.g. North America and Europe) with few studies focused in the tropics.\nMy research takes advantage of cities world-wide as replicated experiments to investigate how environmental context shapes the evolutionary outcomes of urbanization and identify factors that facilitate or constrain species convergence. In doing so, I am to rectify these global biases in knowledge, elevate research & researchers in Central and South America, and help narrow the hemispheric gap that divides our science.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis part of my research is still building - stay tuned as I build parallel urban field systems in Puerto Rico, New York, Seattle, Colombia (Bogotá and Fusagasugá), Panama (Panama City and Gamboa), and Chile (Santiago).\nI am always looking for community members to help me study hummingbirds. If you live in any of these cities (or surrounding rural areas), see hummingbirds around, and want to help me study them - send me an email! I would be extra excited if you have hummingbird feeders or would be interested in starting to maintain one."

    "text": "Global biases in urban eco-evo\nCurrent understanding of urban ecology and evolution is alarmingly biased, stemming disproportionally from the wealthiest nations. This is a problem because the evolutionary outcomes of urbanization likely depend on geographic and ecological context and can vary substantially across latitude. Latin America represents the second most urbanized global region, with 81% of habitants living in urban areas, and contains over 40% of the world’s avian biodiversity, yet current knowledge about the effect of urbanization on organisms is biased toward temperate regions (e.g. North America and Europe) with few studies focused in the tropics.\nMy research takes advantage of cities world-wide as replicated experiments to investigate how environmental context shapes the evolutionary outcomes of urbanization and identify factors that facilitate or constrain species convergence. In doing so, I am to rectify these global biases in knowledge, elevate research & researchers in Central and South America, and help narrow the hemispheric gap that divides our science."

    "text": "Science in the Wild @Patagonia\nLast week I was invited to participate in an event called “Science in the Wild”, hosted by our local Patagonia branch and organized by graduate students in the Department of Natural Resources from the University of Nevada. We each gave a 10-minute popular science talk about our research, emphasizing a “call to action” or specific actions the public can do to be a positive influence for local conservation. I was able to share my work about the effects of light pollution on birds, and some easy steps people can take to minimize impacts! Light pollution is an ecological concern that literally exists our backyards - it doesn’t get more local than that!\nHere is my call to action:\nReplace: Change any bright white light bulbs that are used outdoors to softer, more yellow hues. My research has shown that warmer colored lights are less disruptive for birds. Avoiding the short (blue) wavelengths that are present in whiter light is better for us humans trying to sleep too!\nRedirect: Make sure the light we are using outdoors is going where it’s intended! That means getting covers for street or porch lamps so that they point downward at the street or sidewalk, and not out into the air or surrounding natural habitats. Additionally, use curtains to prevent the light use indoors from spilling out into the environment.\nReduce: On a broad scale, many cities have adopted “lights out” policies to reduce the amount of night light during critical life history events, such as migration or breeding. As individuals, we can reduce night light by investing in motion-sensors (so that lights only turn on when we need them!), or dimmers so that we can reduce the intensity of light when there is extra reflectance (like when there is snow cover).\nRemove: Talk to your local policy makers or employers about removing lights that are redundant or unnecessary. It’s a win-win, reducing impacts on wildlife and saving everyone energy and money!"

Here is one where we talked about the most useful piece of advice we received, and another answering why we do science!\nFor many women and trans and non-binary people, gender has historically been a barrier to full participation in ornithology. For our 2019 meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, the American Ornithological Society worked with the Conservation Media Program at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to produce three short videos of contemporary ornithologists telling the stories of themselves as scientists. Our objectives were to highlight diverse profiles of scientists, to show viewers that diversity is a welcome and indispensable part of a strong science community, and to contribute to the Diversity and Inclusion Committee’s work to reduce barriers to conference attendance.\nWhat is the best piece of advice you have been given?

Since the invention of the first electric light, the development of new technologies continually alters the spectral composition of ALAN emitted into the environment.\nIn just the past decade light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have replaced older lighting technologies as a cheaper and more energy efficient alternative and are commercially available in a variety of spectra. Variation in spectral composition affects how organisms perceive night-light, and determines biological responses - for example, many organisms are particularly sensitive to the short-wavelength light produced by the most common “white” LEDs (e.g. 5000K). However, few studies have compared broad spectrum LED lights that are commercially available and widely used.\nCheck out my first first-authored paper!

Here is one where we talked about the most useful piece of advice we received, and another answering why we do science!\nFor many women and trans and non-binary people, gender has historically been a barrier to full participation in ornithology. For our 2019 meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, the American Ornithological Society worked with the Conservation Media Program at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to produce three short videos of contemporary ornithologists telling the stories of themselves as scientists. Our objectives were to highlight diverse profiles of scientists, to show viewers that diversity is a welcome and indispensable part of a strong science community, and to contribute to the Diversity and Inclusion Committee’s work to reduce barriers to conference attendance.\nWhat is the best piece of advice you have been given?

Since the invention of the first electric light, the development of new technologies continually alters the spectral composition of ALAN emitted into the environment.\nIn just the past decade light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have replaced older lighting technologies as a cheaper and more energy efficient alternative and are commercially available in a variety of spectra. Variation in spectral composition affects how organisms perceive night-light, and determines biological responses - for example, many organisms are particularly sensitive to the short-wavelength light produced by the most common “white” LEDs (e.g. 5000K). However, few studies have compared broad spectrum LED lights that are commercially available and widely used.\nCheck out my first first-authored paper! Artificial light at night disrupts nocturnal rest and increases glucocorticoids in zebra finches."

Sometimes it’s slimy, poop-colored and has a large set of teeth, grinning at you from dark crevices in the bottom of the river.\nI originally pursued conservation biology to “save all the animals” from things like pollution and deforestation, but I was mainly concerned with “cute” animals - polar bears, turtles, maybe dolphins. Instead, I landed a position working with the eastern hellbender (Cryptobranchus alleganiensis), or ‘snot-otters’ as they are known colloquially across their range in rural Appalachia. Perhaps the most beautiful, interesting, and unique herp in North America (shameless bias here), the hellbender was my introduction to the real challenge of conservation: motivating people to connect with, and care about, topics that are unfamiliar or uncomfortable.\nI believe that with some effort it is always possible to find a connection that is meaningful to someone, to help bridge that gap between humans and their environment. Everything is connected - our air, water, soil, microbiome, the cells in our body, and all life on earth. Personally, this interconnectedness is what excites me and draws me to science. Professionally, I do conservation work because the more we discover and describe those connections, the more effectively we can work with them to help our world function and thrive."

    "text": "Urban Ecology & Evolution\nGlobal urbanization is expanding and intensifying - there has been a tripling of urban land cover since 2000 and 68% of people are projected to inhabit cities by 2050. With urbanization comes unprecedented biotic and abiotic changes such as air, noise and light pollution, impervious surfaces, habitat fragmentation, novel inter- and intra-species interactions and an overall reduction in biodiversity. As consequence, many species avoid and/or decline in cities, but others persist and even thrive. For city dwellers, these environmental changes impose selection pressure that may be driving evolution and population divergence. Furthermore, urbanization affects neutral evolutionary processes that impact the distribution of genetic variation, which can in turn affect the adaptive potential and persistence of species. Understanding the variation in traits within and across species along an urban gradient can help us predict how species will adapt in the future to an increasingly warm and urbanized landscape."

    "text": "Global biases in urban ecology\nCurrent understanding of urban ecology and evolution is alarmingly biased, stemming disproportionally from the wealthiest nations. This is a problem because the evolutionary outcomes of urbanization likely depend on geographic and ecological context and can vary substantially across latitude. Latin America represents the second most urbanized global region, with 81% of habitants living in urban areas, and contains over 40% of the world’s avian biodiversity, yet current knowledge about the effect of urbanization on organisms is biased toward temperate regions (e.g. North America and Europe) with few studies focused in the tropics.\nMy research takes advantage of cities world-wide as replicated experiments to investigate how environmental context shapes the evolutionary outcomes of urbanization and identify factors that facilitate or constrain species convergence. In doing so, I am to rectify these global biases in knowledge, elevate research & researchers in Central and South America, and help narrow the hemispheric gap that divides our science."

Outreach education is especially important as an urban ecologist because humans are both members and architects of urban ecosystems. The knowledge my research generates has the potential to directly apply to human lives, and reciprocally, human decision-making has the potential to directly affect the species I study. Moreover, by working in human-dominated landscapes, we have an opportunity to connect with people that maybe otherwise wouldn’t even know to be curious about science. That is why I have designed my fieldwork to rely on community participation. I also take every opportunity to practice communicating my science to general audiences, and create opportunities for my students to do the same."
